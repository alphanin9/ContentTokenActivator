# Content token activator for CP2077

Helps with issues regarding quest activation (for example, SQ026 AKA the Clouds takeover questline being a complete mess).

# Requirements

- Cyber Engine Tweaks
- RED4ext

# Usage

```
ContentHandler.ActivateToken()
```

Alternatively, use the GUI the Cyber Engine Tweaks script provides.

Note that by default there is no Redscript import for ContentHandler, as Cyber Engine Tweaks does not require it.
